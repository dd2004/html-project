<h1>About us</h1>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>Durham House of Pets was founded by Richard Roberts 10 years ago. He came up with the idea when he was fed up
with the foods and products that were availiable for his dog, Cal. Since then we've grown into a regional phenomenon,
becoming the #1 distributer of pet foods and products in New England.
<br>
<h2>Why use us</h2>
<p>We make our own foods and products. Since we don't have to buy from anyone else we're able to sell our products
to our consumers for a very reasonable price. Our foods and products have been developed by our team our expert scientists
and they are guaranteed safe and healthy. We have won a number of awards at various pet food competitions around
the country.</p>
